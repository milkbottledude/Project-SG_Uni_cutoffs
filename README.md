# Project-SG_Uni_cutoffs
Plotting the igps of the various courses in the big 3 unis in Singapore using matplotlib, and hopefully catching some interesting patterns and trends that we can look more into and attempt to justify.

V1: After creating a virtual environment and activating it and creating a requirements.txt file which contains the necessary packages needed, i pip installed all the packages, then imported the packages into the newly created python file, uniscrape.py. I also defined the url variable for the website ill be scraping in the python file.
